## Support Features

This project is very early stateï¼Œ only support a few features following:

- AGSTiledMapServiceLayer
- AGSDynamicMapServiceLayer

Other features need to be added, please wait or add them by yourself.

## Build the Binding project and run test

1. Login to ESRI Online, download and install ArcGIS Runtime SDK **v10.1.1**.
2. Clone this repository to local, for example `~/Projects/MonoTouch.ArcGIS`
3. Copy file `~/Library/SDKs/ArcGIS/iOS/ArcGIS.framework/Versions/Current/ArcGIS` to Binding project folder, and rename it to `libArcGIS.a`
4. Rebuild the Binding project first, if no errors occured, then build the AGSTestCS Project.
5. Run the AGSTestCS

## Usage and Tutorial

- Check ESRI ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS [Guide][2].
- Check ESRI ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS [API reference][3].
- Check the **AGSTestCS** project in this repository.

## How to add new features

Be aware of those files in the Binding project:

- gen.cs: This file is generated by [Objective Sharpie][4] producted by Xamarin, with the *.h files in the Headers folder..
- Api.cs: A modified version of gen.cs, including adjusting names, check the methods or properties, and the generated VerifyAttribte is checked and removed. But still can not be used with the Binding object, a lot of build errors.
- Api_new.cs: Created by hand, add feature on demand, and try always keep this file can be compiled. 

If you need more ArcGIS Api Features, do as follow steps:

- Locate the interface you needed in the Api.cs (prefered) or the gen.cs;
- Copy the interface defination to Api_new.cs, if the interface you copyed reference to other interface, copy the referenced to;
- Try compile the Binding object, ensure there is no error while compiling the project;
- Write some test code in the AGSTestCS project to ensure your new interface works correctly;

Good luck!
