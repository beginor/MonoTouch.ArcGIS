 parameters.) Tracing the geometry from it's first vertex to the last will give 
 you a direction along the geometry. It is to the right and left perspective of 
 this direction that the positive and negative parameters will dictate where the 
 offset is contructed. In these terms it is simple to infer where the offset of 
 even horizontal geometries will be constructed. The @p offsetHow parameter 
 determines how outer corners between segments are handled. Rounded offset rounds 
 the corner between extended offsets. Bevelled offset squares off the corner 
 after a given ratio distance. Mitered offset attempts to allow extended offsets 
 to naturally intersect, but if that intersection occurs too far from the corner, 
 the corner is eventually bevelled off at a fixed distance. The #delegate
 is notified when an operation completes successfully or encounters an error.
