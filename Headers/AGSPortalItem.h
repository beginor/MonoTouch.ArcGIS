/** @brief Object representing a unit of content in the portal. 
 
 An AGSPortalItem is a unit of content in the AGSPortal.  Each item has a unique identifier and a well-
 known URL that is independent of the user owning the item. An item may have associated binary or 
 textual data which has to be fetched explicitly using @c #fetchData.  For example, an item of type @c AGSPortalItemTypeMapPackage will
 fetch the actual bits corresponding to the map package.
 
 The AGSPortalItem's #delegate is informed whenever operations performed by the AGSPortalItem  
 complete successfully or encounter an error.
