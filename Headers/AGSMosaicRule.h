/** @brief Defines how individual images should be mosaicked.
 
 Specifies the mosaic rule when defining how individual images should be
 mosaicked. It specifies selection, mosaic method, sort order, overlapping pixel
 resolution, etc. Mosaic rules are for mosaicking rasters in the mosaic dataset.
 A mosaic rule is used to define:
	- The selection of rasters that will participate in the mosaic (using the where clause).
	- The mosaic method, e.g. how the selected rasters are ordered.
	- The mosaic operation, e.g. how overlapping pixels at the same location are resolved.
