/** @brief A task to compute routes.
 
 Instances of this class represent tasks than can find the best route 
 to get from one location to another or to visit several locations. 
 
 The best route can be the quickest, shortest, or most scenic route, depending on the impedance chosen. 
 If the impedance is time, then the best route is the quickest route. Hence, the best route can
 be defined as the route that has the lowest impedance.
 
 A route task needs a URL to a REST resource that represents a Route layer in a Network Analyst service.
 For example, http://tasks.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/NetworkAnalysis/ESRI_Route_NA/NAServer/Route
