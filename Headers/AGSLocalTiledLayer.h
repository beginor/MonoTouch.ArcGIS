 This object represents a local tiled layer that can display map contents from a tile package (.tpk file) on the device. This layer can function even when the device does not have any network connectivity.

 device with a retina display and you want to take advantage of that display you can set
 this value to YES. The property must be set before the layer loads.

 most tiles are generated only at 96 DPI and do not look better at native resolution. 
 
 When rendering at the native resolution, this layer will use more memory (because more tiles will need to be displayed).
