/** @brief A predicate in the where clause of a web map query
 
 Instances of this class can be used to construct a predicate for @c AGSWebMapQuery#whereClause. The application should provide UI to capture input from the user for each @c AGSWebMapQueryParameter object in @c AGSWebMapQuery#parameters. This input can then be combined with the remaining information in the object to construct a predicate. 
 
 For example, suppose the value of @c #field is "Magnitude", @c #paramOperator is "=", and the value entered by a user is 2. This information can be combined into a string "Magnitude = 2" which can then be used in a whereClause to query for earthqukes with a magnitude of 2.
