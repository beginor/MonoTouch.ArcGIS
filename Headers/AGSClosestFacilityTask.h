/** @brief A task to find closest facilities around a location.
 
 Instances of this class represent tasks that can find the find closest facilities around any location on a network. 
 Finding the closest hospital to an accident, the closest police cars to a crime scene, and the closest store 
 to a customer's address are all examples of closest facility problems. When finding closest facilities, you can specify 
 how many to find and whether the direction of travel is toward or away from them. Once you've found 
 the closest facilities, you can display the best route to or from them, return the
 travel cost for each route, and display directions to each facility. Additionally, 
 you can specify an impedance cutoff beyond which the task should not search for a facility. 
 For instance, you can set up a closest facility problem to search for hospitals within 15 minutes' 
 drive time of the site of an accident. Any hospitals that take longer than 
 15 minutes to reach will not be included in the results
 
 A closest facility task needs a URL to a REST resource that represents a Closest Facility layer in a Network Analyst service.
 For example, http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/NAServer/Closest%20Facility
