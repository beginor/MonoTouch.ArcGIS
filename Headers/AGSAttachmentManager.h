/** @brief Manages attachments belonging to a feature
 
 
 Instances of this class represent a light-weight and coarse-grained object for managing attachments of a particular feature in a feature layer.
 This object allows the user to make changes on the client regarding the attachments collection
 for a feature and then later on either cancel these edits or sync (post) the changes to the server.
 You can get a handle to an attachment manager for a feature using the
 @c AGSFeatureLayer#attachmentManagerForFeature: method.
