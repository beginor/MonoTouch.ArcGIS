/** @brief A task to compute service areas.
 
 Instances of this class represent tasks that can compute service areas. A service area is a region that encompasses 
 all accessible streets, that is, streets that lie within a specified impedance. For instance, the 10-minute service area 
 for a facility includes all the streets that can be reached within 10 minutes from that facility. 
 
 A service area task needs a URL to a REST resource that represents a Service Area layer in a Network Analyst service.
 For example, http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Network/USA/NAServer/Service%20Area
