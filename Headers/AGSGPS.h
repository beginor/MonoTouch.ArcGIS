/** @brief Controls how the map responds to GPS input.

 This object controls how the map responds to location updates. It  provides a simple fa√ßade over the CoreLocation framework and
 greatly simplifies working with location services.
 
 To make the map start 
 responding, use the <code>start</code> method. Ensure the map is loaded successfully before you call <code>start</code>. 
 
 To make the map stop responding, use the 
 <code>stop</code> method. 
 
 By default, the map uses a blue, round symbol to display the device's location. The map will always try to get 
 most accurate location available. Depending upon signal strength, satellite positions, and other factors, the location
 reported could be a best possible approximation. The map displays a blue-circle around the location symbol to indicate the range of accuracy.
 As the device moves, the map will respond to location updates and appropriately udpate the position of the location symbol.
