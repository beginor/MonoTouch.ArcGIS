/** @brief A task to perform geometric operations.
 
 An instance of this class allows you to  perform various frequently used 
 geometric operations using a remote ArcGIS Server Geometry Sservice. 
 For example, <a href="http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Geometry/GeometryServer">http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Geometry/GeometryServer</a>.
 
 Geometric operations include :
 
 @li Buffer, project, and simplify geometries
 @li Calculate areas and lengths for geometries
 @li Determine spatial relations and label points
 @li Compute union, intersection, and difference between geometries
 @li Auto complete, generalize, reshape, offset, trim, extend and compute convex 
 hulls of geometries
 
 The input and output geometries are always packaged in arrays.
