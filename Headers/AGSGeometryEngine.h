 *Creates offset version of the input geometries.
 
 The offset operation creates a geometry that is a constant distance from an input polyline or polygon.
 It is similar to buffering, but produces a one sided result. If offsetDistance > 0, then the offset
 geometry is constructed to the right of the oriented input geometry, otherwise it is constructed to
 the left. For a simple polygon, the orientation of outer rings is clockwise and for inner rings it is counter
 clockwise. So the “right side” of a simple polygon is always its inside.
 The bevelRatio is multiplied by the offset distance and the result determines how far a mitered
 offset intersection can be from the input curve before it is beveled.
