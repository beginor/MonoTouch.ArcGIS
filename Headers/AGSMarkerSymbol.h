/** @brief A base class for marker symbols. 
 
 Instances of this class represent marker symbols. Symbols describe how graphics 
 look on the map. Different symbols are used for graphics with different geometry 
 types.  Marker symbols are used to display those graphics which are based on 
 point or multipoint geometry.

 For example, a value of -5 will shift the marker left by 5 points.
 
 This is useful when the marker needs to be offset to properly coincide with a 
 location on the map. 
 
 For example, consider an @c AGSPictureMarkerSymbol using the image of a pushpin.  
 By default, the center of the image will be used as the anchor to center the 
 image at the map location. However, if you wanted the needle of the pushpin to 
 end at the map location, you would need to specify an #xoffset and a #yoffset 
 to shift the image appropriately.

 be registered only if a user tapped in the middle of the pushpin. To allow the 
 user to tap on the head of the pin to show a callout, you would need to specify the corresponding 
 location's hotspot. Furthermore, the calloutâ€™s leader will be anchored to this hotspot location.
