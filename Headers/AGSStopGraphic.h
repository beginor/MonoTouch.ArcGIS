/** @brief A stop along a route
 
 Instances of this class represent stops - locations that must be visited along a route. 
 Stops are used as inputs to the solve operation of an @c AGSRouteTask. You need atleast
 two stops to compute a route, although you can have more.
 
 Apart from the properties declared on this class, a stop can have additional properties depending upon
 how the Route layer in the Network Analyst service is configured. These properties can 
 be set and accessed through the @c #attributes property.

/** An integer representing the index of the stop. This index value is 1-based. 
 The sequence number indicates the sequence in which you want the stop to be visited by the route.
 
 If you enable the @c findBestSequence property on AGSRouteTaskParameters, 
 the service will attempt to reorder the stops to find the most optimal route. 
 You can also enable the @c preserveFirstStop and @c preserveLastStop properties on AGSRouteTaskParameters 
 if you do not want the origin and destination stops to be reordered.

 If you do not assign a routeName to any stops, all stops will be combined into a single route.
